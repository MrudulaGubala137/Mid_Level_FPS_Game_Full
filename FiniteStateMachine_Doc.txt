Finite State Machine:Finite State Machine are one of the major families of automation.
Automations are abstract models of simple machine. In finite state machine consists of finite 
number of state at agiven time only one state is active. Each state is defines which state it
will transition to as an output based on the sequence of inputs it recieves. The output states 
becomes the new active state in other words a statetransistion occurs.
